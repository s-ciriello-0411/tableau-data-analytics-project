# Tableau Public Project: Average Custom Metrics Dashboard

This project showcases a Tableau dashboard created to analyze custom metrics by country, month, and aircraft. The dashboard is interactive and uses advanced Tableau features such as calculated fields, parameters, and dual-axis charts.

## 📊 Features
- **Map Visualization**: Average custom metric by country.
- **Line Chart**: Average custom metric by month.
- **Dual Bar Chart**: Average custom metric by aircraft.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Combines all visualizations with filtering options.

## 🗂️ Dataset
- The dataset includes aviation-related metrics (custom metric), grouped by country, month, and aircraft type.
- Data is publicly available and was cleaned for use in this analysis.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Tableau Public**
- **Calculated Fields, Parameters, Filters**
- Dashboard Design & Formatting

## 📜 Steps to Reproduce
Here’s a quick overview of the steps I followed to create the dashboard:

**Data Preparation & Overview**
I explored the dataset to understand its structure and identified key metrics for analysis. This step helped me decide on the visualizations to include.

**Map: Average Metric by Country** 
I created an interactive map to visualize metrics by country. I used a parameter for dynamic metric selection and calculated fields to compute averages.

**Line Chart: Average Metric by Month** 
I designed a line chart to highlight monthly trends. Formatting and axis adjustments were key to ensuring clarity.

**Dual Bar Chart: Metric by Aircraft** 
I built a dual bar chart to compare metrics by aircraft type, leveraging dual axes for a compact yet informative design.

**Dashboard Design** 
Finally, I brought all visualizations together into a single dashboard. I focused on creating a clean layout with interactive filters for user-friendly navigation.
